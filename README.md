# Folder-Hash-Checker
A Script for double checking the Hashes of two folders. I used this Prevoiusly when backing up a 2 TB Hard Drive and wanted to make sure nothing got corrupted. Took several Hours to Run as the Verson here is single Threaded, I should have a multi-Threaded Version, but it's MIA as of right now.
